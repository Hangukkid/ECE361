No successful pings.

Q3: shows the two new connections that were just created. 
cookie, duration, table, # packets, # bytes, in port and its action

Q4:
successful pings now since there is a direct flow between h1 and h2.

Q5:
creates a new entry with same entries as the flow created in Q2 except instead 
of in_port, there is priority,dl_dst and dl_type.

Q6:
1 -> 2 and 2 -> 1 works
1 -> 3 and 2 -> 3 don't work (3 is still unconnected)

n_packets for 1st and 2nd go up by 5.
