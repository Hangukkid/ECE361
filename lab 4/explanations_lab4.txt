concurrency:
I implemented concurrency on the server using threads. 
For every client there is a thread that handles interaction with the server.

Select waits for input like polling operation whereas the threads can handle functions concurrently.
While thread can use sleep functionality to reduce CPU waste, select will just poll for a while 
which guarantees some CPU waste if the user is slow to input.

The server handles messages between clients. More stress on the server side and 
less on the client side.
