R average = 999.878337 bits/s,          tprop average = 0.500162 s

sim2.o
R average = 999.572329 bits/s,          tprop average = 2.000140 s

sim3.o
R average = 99.996560 bits/s,   tprop average = 0.100145 s

Process:
assuming tproc = 0 and tframe = tack
t_0 = 2*t_prop + 2*n/R
The unknowns are t_prop and R, using two points, we can find their values.
Observations:
No failures likely due to only sending to localhost. 
R is not the same for all simulators.
Running the client before the server will make the client wait until timeout for send().
